# Food Environment Analysis

## Analysis of U.S. Food Environment demographic and geographic factors to inform community hunger relief services
## **Objective**
The primary project goal is to explore the dataset to find correlations factors that contribute to food insecurity: food access in terms of the proximity of restaurants and stores in an area, demographics of communities, and health outcomes.
#### The people served in the hunger relief sector access food from food shelves for many reasons, a primary one being food insecurity. Multiple intersecting factors converge to create circumstances of food insecurity among Americans. Understanding the interconnection of these factors can help us identify and support at-risk members of our communities with hunger relief services.

#### The following python libraries were used for this project:
* pandas, numpy, sklearn, pylab - cleaning, filtering, analysis
* seaborn, matplotlib, os, folium, json - visualization
